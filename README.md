This is a React Native App which challenges users to not click on a famous person twice.

## Deployment 

This application can be found [here.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memorygame1234.game/)

## User Experience

After the page loads a header, scoreboard, and image grid are displayed.

The image grid is shuffled on every page load and image click regardless of choice.
Clicking one of the images starts the game and adds +1 to your score.

This counter helps the user keep track of images left to click
If all images are clicked successfully. A message telling the user so pops up and the game starts over.

If an incorrect choice is made the user is informed what mistake was made and given the opportunity to immediately restart.
